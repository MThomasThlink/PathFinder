# GUI
Allows user to create a squared field with points and define the (weighted) connections.

# Path finding
Uses BFS to find the best path between source and destination but also calculates alternatives (not directly through BFS).

Small 5x5 area with two clear paths between points 1 and 19.
Route 0 is the best: 4 steps, followed by route 1 (9 steps)
